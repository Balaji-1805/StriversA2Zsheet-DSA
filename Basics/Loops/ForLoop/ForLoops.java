/* 
In java For loops are used to execute a specific block of code repeatedly
It is used when we know the exact no of iterations 
Note Points:
Initialization: You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. This step only happens once at the beginning.
Condition: You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.
Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.
